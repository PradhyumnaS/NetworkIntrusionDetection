# Intelligent Network Intrusion Detection with Anomaly Detection

Random Forest-Based Intrusion Detection: Implemented a network intrusion detection system using the Random Forest algorithm to identify malicious activities and potential threats in network traffic, ensuring high detection accuracy and low false positives.

Efficient Real-Time Monitoring: The system analyzes network logs in real-time, classifying traffic patterns as normal or intrusive, providing immediate alerts for prompt security intervention.

Tech: Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Pandas, NumPy
